# Node OpenId Connect

This project is a fork of [node-oidc-provider](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider) version 6.29.7.

Little (if any) changes were made to the `/lib` folder.

Most changes made were related to working around the restrictive API around consent and views.

For future development, [their example folder](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider/tree/master/example) is a good place to start.
